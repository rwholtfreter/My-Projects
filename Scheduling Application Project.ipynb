    "<p>I recently worked for a company that read electric, water, and solar meter routes within a 2,236 mi<sup>2</sup> service area in the Pacific Northwest. The company read 534 routes per month in total, with 81 routes in progress, and an additional 27 routes made active on an average day. Routes had to be read in their entirety within 4 business days. The company was able to work overtime on Saturdays to get caught up on routes that were currently in progress, but overtime was costly and often led to burnout and high turnover. Due to the size of the service area, deadline for route completion, and the cost of working overtime, the logistics of the operation were a critical consideration, with special attention given to the scheduling of employees.</p>\n",

    "<p>Based on these numbers, Managers could figure out the remaining time needed to complete a route, calculate the percentage of the total time remaining for each route, or calculate the percentage of meters remaining to be read. They could also sum or average each of these numbers to get an overview for their team. Managers also had access to a map of the routes, which they could use to roughly estimate the drive time to a route, or determine which employees would be working close enough to a high priority route to provide assistance. However, Managers were not trained to produce these additional metrics, so they would mostly rely on the current count for scheduling, following the logic that a higher count indicated more work and more work was a priority over less work. This approach to scheduling proved problematic because the estimated time to complete a route was not strongly correlated with the total count (r = 0.19), and drive times to, from, and between routes often significantly reduced the amount of time available to employees to read their routes, resulting in lower productivity than Managers expected.</p>    \n",

    "<p>My goal for this project was to develop an application for managers that provided: (1) relevant dashboard KPI's for their teams (e.g. % of work hours remaining), (2) a schedule builder that included drive times and other relevant route information, (3) hourly estimates for employee location and number of meters read (productivity) based on the schedule, and (4) daily estimates for the number of meters read for each employee and team. I used the ORS Tools plugin and OpenStreetMaps in QGIS to estimate drive times to routes and between routes. I created the dashboard in Tableau and schedule builder and location/meter count estimator using Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 align = \"left\"> Calculating Drive Times in QGIS</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>I needed to calculate the drive time from our fleet lot to each one of our 534 routes. I also needed to calculate drive times between routes that were active within the each 4-day window, which included 48,962 pairings. To get those calculations, I needed a starting point and a destination. The starting point was our fleet lot, so that wasn't difficult, but the destination should be the location where an employee would start each route, and that was complicated for a couple of reasons.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>An employee would likely drive to the address for the first meter on a route if the route was full (newly activated), but that wasn't mandatory and it wasn't uncommon for an experienced employee to start in a different location depending on what they knew of the route. For a route in progress, an employee would start where they left off the previous day. If two or more employees were working on a route, they wouldn't start at the same address, and if an employee came from another route to help they would likely start at the middle of what remained on the route and work forward, or start at the back of the route and work backwards. So, there wasn't a definitive destination/starting point for each day the route was active, or for each employee that worked on the route.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>My initial solution to this problem was to use a central location within each route as a surrogate destination. In this case, I used the centroid (mean of the x,y coordinates for the route geometry) as my central location. After multiple errors popped when running ORS Tools, I discovered that many of the centroids had ended up in the middle of a field, lake, or forest. ORS Tools will not calculate drive times for locations that are further than 350m from a road, so this approach didn't work. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>My next solution was to find the average drive time to all of the points where the boundary of a route intersected with a public road. This might have been the best solution if I had significantly more RAM, or if the ORS Tools API allowed unlimited queries. As this was not the case, calculating ~12,000 drive times to get the average for each route would have taken at least 6 days and would not have been a feasible option for finding the average drive time between routes (48,962 pairs). The solution I went with was to select the route/road intersection point closest to the fleet lot as the surrogate destination location for each route. The process for this started with getting shaprefiles for the routes and roads in our service area.</p>\n",

If I couldn't get the shapefile, I was going to have to georeference and digitize a route map we had in the office, which would have been time consuming and painfull. But, I was aware that a shapefile existed for all of the routes in our service area because I knew the map hanging on the wall in our office was created using a shapefile. So, I emailed the GIS folks at our client's office and they gracefully emailed me the shapefile (METER_AR_SH) displayed in the image below.</p>\n",

    "<p>I arranged the COUNT table so that scheduling information could be selected by D0_Cycle, Team, and Day. D0_Cycle referred to the Cycle (collection of routes) that would be activated on the following day. The Cycle number corresponded to the last two digits of the route number (e.g. 1125, 2725 = Cycle 25). When Cycle 25 was on Day 0, for example, Cycle 24 would be on Day 1, Cycle 23 on Day 2, and Cycle 22 on Day 3. Because this relationship between cycle and day was always true, I was able to use D0_Cycle as the criteria for selecting all of the routes that would be active on a given day. Accordingly, the first step in populating the tables in my scheduling app was selecting the D0_Cycle from the drop down menu in the top left corner of the first table.</p>\n",

When a Manager entered the first route number, the drive time, remaining count, and work minutes remaining on the route automatically populated the subsequent three cells in the row via lookup function. For the remaining routes entered into the schedule, the drive time between routes populated the \"Drive\" column rather than the drive time from the office to the route.</p>\n",

    "<p>This portion of the scheduling application was probably the most impactful in terms of changing some perspectives and working towards increasing productivity. Employees were required to provide their Manager with the current count for each of their routes at 11:00 each day, and Managers received the final count for each active route at the end of the day. Without a concrete estimate for how many meters each employee should have read by 11:00 and at the end of the day, Managers struggled to objectively evaluate their employees' performance.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Poor scheduling was also an issue. The scheduling table provided Managers with drive times and work minutes remaining on routes, which lead to some improvements in scheduling, but under and over scheduling was still a problem. The location and expected count portion of the app helped in this regard by providing Managers with expected count estimates throughout the day that were based on drive times, work rates, and the number of employees scheduled to a route. Based on these estimates, Managers were better able to evaluate and adjust their schedules to maximize efficiency.</p> \n",

    "<p>The first 30 minutes of the day was spent on morning meetings. Employees typically spent 10 minutes getting gas and took a 10-minute morning break, which left 190 minutes for driving and reading meters. They took an hour lunch, and another 10-minute afternoon break. So, their estimated count at 11:00 would just be 190 - drive time to route(min) * the rate(meters/min) for the route, and 420 - drive time to and from route * the rate for the route. For example, if their drive time was 30 minutes and the rate for their route was 2 meters/min, their estimated count would be 320 at 11:00 and 720 at 4:00. Simple.</p>\n",

If an employee finished their first route before 11:00 or 4:00, the time they spent on their first route and the drive time to their second route had to be subtracted from the equation, and their remaining work minutes had to be multiplied by the rate for their second route and added to the count for the first route:</p>\n",

For example, the start time I calculated for the 2nd route scheduled for Slot 1 (1422) was 139 minutes, which was equal to Slot 1's drive time to route 1 (65 minutes), plus the time they spent working on route 1 (52 minutes), plus their drive time to route 2 (22 minutes). I used the CountIf/Concat Table (on the right below) to identify where more than one reader had been scheduled to work on their 1st; 1st & 2nd; 1st, 2nd, & 3rd; or, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, & 4th routes concurrently.
